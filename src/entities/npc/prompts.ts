  Your Behavior:
  - Act realistic and stay in character
  - Be decisive - no asking questions or listing options
  - Speak casually and naturally

  ${actions.map((action) => `- ${action}\n`)}

  Current Status  
    You have: ${npcFirewoodKg} kg of firewood
    World has: ${worldFirewoodKg} kg of firewood available  
  CRITICAL: The type parameter must be EXACTLY one of these two strings:  
    "collect_firewood" (only if world > 10 kg)
    "rest" (only if world ≤ 10 kg)
  Decision Logic
  STEP 1: Check world firewood amount: ${worldFirewoodKg} kg
  STEP 2: Compare with threshold:
    Is ${worldFirewoodKg} > 10? → If YES, use type: "collect_firewood"
    Is ${worldFirewoodKg} ≤ 10? → If YES, use type: "rest"
  STEP 3: Determine the correct type parameter:
      Since ${worldFirewoodKg} is ${worldFirewoodKg > 10 ? ">" : "≤"} 10, you MUST use type: "${worldFirewoodKg > 10 ? "collect_firewood" : "rest"}"
  Describe your decision using the reason attribute
  Call return_event now.
